## Project Management
  
### Team Collaboration and Meetings

- Regular Meetings: Our team held weekly meetings every Tuesday (adjust depending on individual needs or progress) online or on campus to discuss project progress, address any issues, and plan for the upcoming week. Meeting minutes are available in the Wiki section of our GitHub repository.
  
- Communication Tools: We used WeChat for daily communication and projectManager (as shown in the below image) to track tasks and deadlines and ensure all team members stayed informed and engaged.

### Version Control and Workflow

- Git Workflow: We adopted the branch workflow. This approach helped us manage the development of new features without disturbing the main codebase. Each feature was developed in a separate branch and reviewed through pull requests before merging into the main.

- Code Reviews: Pull requests were used to review all code changes. This practice ensured code quality and shared understanding of the codebase among team members.

### Task Management

- Task Assignment: Tasks were assigned during our first couple of weekly meetings based on team members' skills and learning goals. The  details can be found on our projectManager board, which reflects the current status of each task, including 'To Do,' 'Doing,' and 'Done.'

- Progress Tracking: Progress was tracked using ProjectManager, where team members regularly updated tasks.

### Quality Assurance

- Code Reviews: All pull requests underwent thorough reviews by at least two other team members before merging to ensure quality and consistency.

### Regular Contributions and Commits

- Commit Logs: Our commit logs reflect regular contributions from all team members. Each commit clearly describes the implemented changes, ensuring traceability and transparency.

- Peer Reviews: Each piece of code was peer-reviewed, fostering knowledge sharing and collective code ownership.
